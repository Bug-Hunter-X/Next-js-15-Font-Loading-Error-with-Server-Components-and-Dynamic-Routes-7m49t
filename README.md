This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to font loading in Next.js 15 applications utilizing server components and dynamic routes. The bug occurs when font loading logic depends on dynamic route parameters, causing fonts to fail to load on the client-side. The solution involves refactoring the font loading mechanism to ensure it works correctly with SSR and client-side hydration.

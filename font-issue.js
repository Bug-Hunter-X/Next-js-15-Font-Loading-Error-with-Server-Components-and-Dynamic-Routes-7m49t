In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using the `next/font` API with server components and dynamic routing.  The issue manifests when the font files are not correctly loaded on the client-side, leading to missing or incorrectly displayed fonts. This happens if the font loading logic depends on dynamic route parameters that are not available during server-side rendering (SSR).
